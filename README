Welcome to this short explanation consisting of a few important things you need to know about the game you're about to play.

First of all, we have to tell you that this game isn't working correctly as it is supposed to be.
That's due to two small problems that occur when trying to place a move on the board or whilst trading tiles, so that
the move you want to make as a client can't be placed or the tiles can't be traded. Another issue that comes with these problems
is that you can't see your hand as a player. We do realize that this obviously is a huge problem,
since the game actually can't be played because of this. What we do want to say though is that for the
rest the game is implemented and working fine. Players can connect to the server, can send and receive messages from and to the
server all according to the protocol. We do have working implementations for checking whether a move is valid or
not, we do actually have implementations for tradeMove, methods to be able to challenge another player, be able to sign
up for a game with a certain amount of players (you can send the amount you want to play with) and furthermore everything
you need in order to play the game. Multiple tests are made so you can still check whether or not those implementations are correct.
Once again we understand the consequences of those problems, but hopefully you can see the amount of time and effort we have actually
put into this project, despite the problem we encountered which is explained in the planning reflection (Herjan missed a complete week
because of the death of his grandfather. We're not sure whether this project can be repaired or not, but if the work we handed in turnes out
to be not sufficient enough for a 6, we can assure your we'll be able to repair the game in a very short amount of time, so that the game
can actually be played correctly.

Thanks for your time and understanding, and hopefully you can still enjoy our project.
