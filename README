Welcome to this short explanation consisting of a few important things you need to know about the game you're about to play.

First of all, we have to tell you that this game isn't working correctly.
That's due to two small problems that occur when trying to place a move on the board or whilst trading tiles, so that
the move you want to make as a client can't be placed or the tiles can't be traded. Another issue that comes with these problems
is that you can't see your hand as a player. We do realize that this obviously is a huge problem,
since the game actually can't be played because of this. What we do want to say though is that for the
rest the game is implemented and working fine. Players can connect to the server, can send and receive messages from and to the
server all according to the protocol. We do have working implementations for checking whether a move is valid or
not, we do actually have implementations for tradeMove, methods to be able to challenge another player, be able to sign
up for a game with a certain amount of players (you can send the amount you want to play with) and furthermore everything
you need in order to play the game. Multiple tests are made so you can still check whether or not those implementations are correct.

To perform a system test, the class Server must be started and a Client will be able to connect by starting the Client
class (as many times as you want) and following the instructions that appear on the console.

Thanks for your time and understanding, and hopefully you can still enjoy our project.
